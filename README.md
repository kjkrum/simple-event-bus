# simple-event-bus
A type-safe event publication API designed for Android, Swing, and other Java frameworks.  Key classes include the `EventBus` interface and its concrete implementations, `SimpleEventBus` and `StickyEventBus`. The entire API consists of around five interfaces and ten small, composable classes.
 
 As suggested by the 0.x version number, this library is in development and the API is subject to change.  The author has used `simple-event-bus` in a few Android projects, and plans to declare version 1.0 after using it in at least one non-Android project, hopefully by the end of 2016.

## `SimpleEventBus`
* Events may be broadcast from any thread.
* Events are dispatched by a single-threaded `Executor`.  The executor may simply delegate to the framework's main thread.
* **Event receivers should be registered and unregistered only in the executor thread.**
* Receivers are stored in sets, not lists.
* The order in which receivers are called is controlled by a receiver set factory.
* Events are delivered to receivers that were registered when the event was broadcast, and which are still registered when the event is delivered.
* Each event bus may have an exception pipeline on which it broadcasts runtime exceptions thrown by its receivers.
* A receiver that throws an exception is immediately unregistered.
* Any number of buses can share the same executor, exception pipeline, and receiver set factory.

## `StickyEventBus`
All of the above, plus:

* Stickiness is a property of the bus, not a property of events.
* A sticky bus retains a strong reference to the last event broadcast.
* The stuck event is dispatched to subsequently registered receivers.
* The stuck event can be cleared.
  
# Examples
A typical executor:
```java
public class AndroidExecutor implements Executor {
    private final Handler mHandler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

    @Override
    public void execute(final Runnable command) {
        mHandler.post(command);
    }
}
```

Basic usage:
```java
// in any thread
final Executor executor = new AndroidExecutor();
final EventBus<Exception> exceptionBus =
        new SimpleEventBus<>(executor, null);
final EventBus<Foo> fooBus =
        new StickyEventBus<>(executor, exceptionBus);
// in main thread
fooBus.register(new EventReceiver<Foo> {
    @Override
    onEvent(@Nonnull final EventBus<Foo> bus, @Nonnull final Foo event) {
        // ...
    }
});
// in any thread
fooBus.broadcast(new Foo(42));
```
In this example, `mFooReceiver` will receive the event if and only if `fooBus` is sticky:
```java
// in any thread
fooBus.broadcast(new Foo(888));
// in main thread, sometime later
fooBus.register(mFooReceiver);
```
In this example, `mFooReceiver` is guaranteed not to receive the event:
```java
// in any thread
fooBus.broadcast(new Foo(13013));
// in main thread, before event is dispatched
fooBus.unregister(mFooReceiver);
```
This guarantee is especially important on Android, where a delayed call to an unregistered receiver could easily lead to a crash.
